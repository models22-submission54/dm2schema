# dm2schema: A submodule commited for Manuscript 54 [MODELS22]

**Paper**: "Proving correctness for SQL implementations of OCL constraints"

## dm2schema
The submodule is for mapping datamodels to SQL schemata.
Given a datamodel (in JSON format), **dm2schema** generates a Java object representation of this datamodel.

**Note**: This repository stores the source code of the text-to-model transformation. This code will be exported to a JAR file and included as a submodule in the main project(s). Although it can operate as a standalone software, its functionality will not be discussed in detail here since it is out of the manuscript scope.
